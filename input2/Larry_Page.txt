search ranking algorithm for Google18 for which he received the Marconi Prize in 2004 along with cowriter Brin19Early lifeLawrence Edward Page was born on March 26 197320 in Lansing Michigan2122 His mother is Jewish23 his maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel22 though Pages household while growing up washis maternal grandfather later immigrated to Israel22 though Pages household while growing up was secular2324 His father Carl Victor Page Sr earned a PhD in computer science from the University of Michigan BBC reporter Will Smale described him as a pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence25 Pages paternal grandparents came from a Protestant background2627 Pages father was a computer science professor at Michigan State University and his mother Gloria was an instructor in computer programming at Lyman Briggs College at the same institution282529 Larrys parents divorced when he was eight years old but he maintained a good relationship both with his mother Gloria and his fathers longterm partner and MSU professor Joyce Wildenthal30ch 2When Larry Page was six years old in 1979 his father brought home an Exidy Sorcerer computer which Larry soon mastered and began using for schoolwork31During an interview Page recalled his childhood home was usually a mess with computersschoolwork31During an interview Page recalled his childhood home was usually a mess with computers science and technology magazines and Popular Science magazines all over the place an environment in which he immersed himself32 Page was an avid reader during his youth writing in his 2013 Google founders letter I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring sic over books and magazines33 According to writer Nicholas Carlson the combined influence of Pages home atmosphere and his attentive parents fostered creativity and invention Page also played instruments and studied music composition while growing up His parents sent him to music summer campInterlochen Arts Camp in Interlochen Michigan and Page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing In some sense I feel like music training led to the highspeed legacy of Google for me In an interview Page said that In music youre very cognizant of time Time is like the primary thingIn an interview Page said that In music youre very cognizant of time Time is like the primary thing and that If you think about it from a music point of view if youre a percussionist you hit something its got to happen in milliseconds fractions of a second11Page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old as he was able to play with the stuff lying aroundfirstgeneration personal computersthat had been left by his mother and father28 He became the first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor34 His older brother Carl Victor Page Jr30ch 2 also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking everything in his house apart to see how it worked He said that from a very early age I also realized I wanted to invent things So I became interested in technology and business Probably from when I was 12 I knew I was going to start a company eventually34EducationPage attended Okemos Montessori School now called Montessori Radmoor ineventually34EducationPage attended Okemos Montessori School now called Montessori Radmoor in Okemos Michigan from ages 2 to 7 1975 to 1979 He attended East Lansing High School graduating in 1991 In summer school he attended Interlochen Center for the Arts at Interlochen Michigan playing flute but mainly saxophone for two summersPage received a Bachelor of Science with a major in computer engineering with honors from the University of Michigan in 1995 and a Master of Science in computer science from Stanford University in 199835363738While at the University of Michigan Page created an inkjet printer made of Lego bricks literally a line plotter after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridgesPage reverseengineered the ink cartridge and built the electronics and mechanics to drive it28 Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu honor society39 and was a member of the 1993 Maize Blue University of Michiganof the Eta Kappa Nu honor society39 and was a member of the 1993 Maize Blue University of Michigan Solar Car team40 As an undergraduate at the University of Michigan he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a personal rapidtransit system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger11 He also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time41PhD studies and researchAfter enrolling in a computer science PhD program at Stanford University Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the World Wide Web understanding its link structure as a huge graph His supervisor Terry Winograd encouraged him to pursue the idea and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received42 He also considered doing research on telepresence and selfdriving cars during this time43444546Page focused on the problem of finding outand selfdriving cars during this time43444546Page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page The role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research46 Sergey Brin a fellow Stanford PhD student would soon join Pages research project nicknamed BackRub46 Together the pair authored a research paper titled The Anatomy of a LargeScale Hypertextual Web Search Engine which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the Internet at the time2844John Battelle cofounder of Wired magazine wrote that Page had reasoned thatthe entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citationafter all what is a link but a citation If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web as Page puts it the Web would become a more valuable place46Battelle further described how Page and Brin began workingWeb would become a more valuable place46Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working together on the projectAt the time Page conceived of BackRub the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents with an untold number of links between them The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project Unaware of exactly what he was getting into Page began building out his crawler The ideas complexity and scale lured Brin to the job A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating I talked to lots of research groups around the school Brin recalls and this was the most exciting project both because it tackled the Web which represents human knowledge and because I liked Larry46Search engine developmentTo convert the backlink data gathered by BackRubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page Brin and Page developed theBackRubs web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones46 The algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another47Combining their ideas the pair began utilizing Pages dormitory room as a machine laboratory and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the now nascent search engine with Stanfords broadband campus network46 After filling Pages room with equipment they then converted Brins dorm room into an office and programming center where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web The rapid growth of their project caused Stanfords computing infrastructure to experience problems48Page and Brin used the formers basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have abasic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users it required additional servers to process the queries In August 1996 the initial version of Google still on the Stanford University website was made available to Internet users46The mathematical website interlinking that the PageRank algorithm facilitates illustrated by sizepercentage correlation of the circles The algorithm was named after Page himselfBy early 1997 the BackRub page described the state as followsSome Rough Statistics from August 29 1996Total indexable HTML URLs 752306

talented implementation help Sergey Brin has also been very involved and deserves many thanksLarry Page pagecsstanfordedu49BackRub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance Page recalled We realized that we had a querying tool It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of followup pages50 Page said that in mid1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project Pretty soon we had 10000 searches a day And we figured maybe this is real48Page and Brins vision has been compared to that of Johannes Gutenberg the inventor of modern printing51In 1440 Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanicalthe inventor of modern printing51In 1440 Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press printing Bibles for mass consumption The technology allowed for books and manuscripts originally replicated by hand to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance Google has done a similar jobThe comparison was also noted by the authors of The Google Story Not since Gutenberg has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as Google30 Also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health information48Page in 2003Google19982000FoundingMark Malseed wrote in a 2003 feature storySoliciting funds from faculty members family and friends Brin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo ParkBrin and Page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park Soon after Sun Microsystems cofounder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a 100000 cheque to Google Inc The only problem was Google Inc did not yet existthe company hadnt yet been incorporated For two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the money52In 199853 Brin and Page incorporated Google Inc54 with the initial domain name of Googol derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zeros representing the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore Using the garage in their friend Susan Wojcickis Menlo Park home for 1700 a month Page and Brin were able to successfully build the Google search engine55 Following inception Page appointed himself as CEO while Brin named Googles cofounder was Googles president11 Writer Nicholas Carlson wrote in 2014The pairs mission was to organize the worlds information and make itNicholas Carlson wrote in 2014The pairs mission was to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful56 With a US1million loan from friends and family the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000 In 1999 Page experimented with smaller servers so Google could fit more into each square meter of the thirdparty warehouses the company rented for their servers This eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than Googles competitors at the time11By June 2000 Google had indexed one billion Internet URLs Uniform Resource Locators making it the most comprehensive search engine on the Web at the time The company cited NEC Research Institute data in its June 26 press release stating that there are more than 1 billion web pages online today with Google providing access to 560 million fulltext indexed web pages and 500 million partially indexed URLs57Early management styleDuring his first tenure as CEO Page embarked on anpartially indexed URLs57Early management styleDuring his first tenure as CEO Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Googles project managers in 2001 Pages plan involved all of Googles engineers reporting to a VP of engineering who would then report directly to himPage explained that he did not like nonengineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge11 Page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a referenceDo not delegate Do everything you can yourself to make things go fasterDo not get in the way if youre not adding value Let the people doing the work talk to each other while you go do something elseDo not be a bureaucratIdeas are more important than age Just because someone is junior does not mean they do not deserve respect and cooperationThe worst thing you can do is stop someone from doing something by saying No Period If you say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done11Even though Pages new model wasyou say no you have to help them find a better way to get it done11Even though Pages new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees his issue with engineers being managed by nonengineering staff gained traction58 Page also believed that the faster Googles search engine returned answers the more it would be used He fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineersfrom those who developed algorithms to those who built data centersto think about lag times He also pushed for keeping Googles home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the page load faster4120012011Left to right Eric Schmidt Sergey Brin and Larry Page 2008Changes in management and expansionBefore Silicon Valleys two most prominent investors Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital agreed to invest a combined total of 50 million in Google they applied pressure on Page to step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team Pageto step down as CEO so that a more experienced leader could build a worldclass management team Page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology CEOs including Steve Jobs and Intels Andrew Grove Eric Schmidt who had been hired as chairman of Google in March 2001 left his fulltime position as the CEO of Novell to take the same role at Google in August of the same year and Page moved aside to assume the president of products role11Under Schmidts leadership Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion which included its initial public offering IPO on August 20 2004 He always acted in consultation with Page and Brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system Page remained the boss at Google in the eyes of the employees as he gave final approval on all new hires and it was Page who provided the signature for the IPO the latter making him a billionaire at the age ofwas Page who provided the signature for the IPO the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 3011Page led the acquisition of Android for 50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere The purchase was made without Schmidts knowledge but the CEO was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition Page became passionate about Android and spent large amounts of time with Android CEO and cofounder Andy Rubin By September 2008 TMobile launched the G1 the first phone using Android software and by 2010 172 of the handset market consisted of Android sales overtaking Apple for the first time Android became the worlds most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward11Assumption of CEO position at GoogleFollowing a January 2011 announcement59 Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4 2011 while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman60 By this time Googleon April 4 2011 while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman60 By this time Google had over 180 billion market capitalization and more than 24000 employees61 Reporter Max Nisen described the decade prior to Pages second appointment as Googles CEO as Pages lost decade saying that while he exerted significant influence at Google via product development and other operations he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time1158Schmidt announced the end of his tenure as CEO on January 20 2011 jokingly tweeting on Twitter Adultsupervision no longer needed6220112013As Googles new CEO Pages two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions and higher levels of collaboration communication and unity among the teams Then Page also formed what the media called the LTeam a group of senior vicepresidents who reported directly to him and worked near his office for a portion of the working week63 Additionallydirectly to him and worked near his office for a portion of the working week63 Additionally he reorganized the companys senior management placing a CEOlike manager at the top of Googles most important product divisions including YouTube AdWords and Google Search11Following a more cohesive team environment Page declared a new zero tolerance for fighting policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of Google when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with Brin as an exemplar for senior management Page had changed his thinking during his time away from the CEO role as he eventually concluded that ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic As part of Pages collaborative rejuvenation process Googles products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul5864Changes and consolidation processAt least 70 of Googles products features and services were eventually shut down by March 2013 while the appearance and nature of the remainingservices were eventually shut down by March 2013 while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified6566 Jon Wiley lead designer of Google Search at the time codenamed Pages redesign overhaul which officially commenced on April 4 2011 Project Kennedy based on Pages use of the term moonshots to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 Wired interview6467 An initiative named Kanna previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for Googles range of products but it was too difficult at that point in the companys history for one team to drive such change Matias Duarte senior director of the Android user experience when Kennedy started explained in 2013 that Google passionately cares about design Page proceeded to consult with the Google Creative Lab design team based in New York City to find an answer to his question of what a cohesive vision of Google might look like64The eventual results of Kennedy which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 untillook like64The eventual results of Kennedy which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013 were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon refinement white space cleanliness elasticity usefulness and most of all simplicity The final products were aligned with Pages aim for a consistent suite of products that can move fast and Kennedy was called a design revolution by Duarte Pages UXA usergraphics interface design team then emerged from the Kennedy project tasked with designing and developing a true UI framework that transforms Googles application software into a beautiful mature accessible and consistent platform for its users Unspoken of in public the small UXA unit was designed to ensure that Kennedy became an institution64Acquisition strategy and new productsWhen acquiring products and companies for Google Page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question Is it something youpassed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier asking the question Is it something you will use once or twice a day and does it make your life better This approach looked for usefulness above profitability and longterm potential over nearterm financial gain which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes686970With Facebooks influence rapidly expanding during the start of Pages second tenure he finally responded to the intensive competition with Googles own social network Google in mid2011 After several delays the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by Vic Gundotra Googles then senior vice president of social71In August 2011 Page announced that Google would spend 125 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility72 The purchase was primarily motivated by Googles need to secure patents to protect Android from lawsuits by companies including Apple Inc11 Page wrote on Googles official blog on August 15 2011 that companies including MicrosoftInc11 Page wrote on Googles official blog on August 15 2011 that companies including Microsoft and Apple are banding together in anticompetitive patent attacks on Android The United States Department of Justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Googles patent portfolio which will enable us to better protect Android from anticompetitive threats from Microsoft Apple and other companies7374 In 2014 Page sold Motorola Mobility for 29 billion to Personal Computer maker Lenovo which represented a loss in value of 95 billion over two years75Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012 The hardware product was a laptop that ran on a Google operating system ChromeOS7620132015In January 2013 Page participated in a rare interview with Wired in which writer Steven Levy discussed Pages 10XPage participated in a rare interview with Wired in which writer Steven Levy discussed Pages 10X mentalityGoogle employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitorsin the introductory blurb Astro Teller the head of Google X explained to Levy that 10X is just core to who he Page is while Pages focus is on where the next 10X will come from67 In his interview with Levy Page referred to the success of YouTube and Android as examples of crazy ideas that investors were not initially interested in saying If youre not doing some things that are crazy then youre doing the wrong things67 Page also stated he was very happy with the status of Google and discussed concerns over the Internet concerning the SOPA bill and an International Telecommunication Union proposal that had been recently introducedI do think the Internets under much greater attack than it has been in the past Governments are now afraid of the Internet because ofgreater attack than it has been in the past Governments are now afraid of the Internet because of the Middle East stuff and so theyre a little more willing to listen to what I see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting peoples freedoms But theyve also seen a tremendous user reaction like the backlash against SOPA I think that governments fight users freedoms at their peril67At the May 2013 IO developers conference in San Francisco Page delivered a keynote address and said Were at maybe 1 of what is possible Despite the faster change were still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have I think a lot of that is because of the negativity Every story I read is Google vs someone else Thats boring We should be focusing on building the things that dont exist and that he was sad the Web isnt advancing as fast as it should be citing a perceived focus on negativity and zerosum games among some in the technology sector as a cause77 In response to anon negativity and zerosum games among some in the technology sector as a cause77 In response to an audience question Page noted an issue that Google had been experiencing with Microsoft whereby the latter made its Outlook program interoperable with Google but did not allow for backward compatibilityhe referred to Microsofts practice as milking off During the questionandanswer section of his keynote Page expressed interest in Burning Man which Brin had previously praisedit was a motivating factor for the latter during Schmidts hiring process as Brin liked that Schmidt had attended the weeklong annual event117877In September 2013 Page launched the independent Calico initiative a RD project in the field of biotechnology Google announced that Calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health and appointed Art Levinson chairman of Apples board and former CEO of Genentech to be the new divisions CEO

thinking around healthcare and biotechnology I believe we can improve millions of lives79Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver British Columbia Canada The presentation was scripted by Pages chief PR executive Rachel Whetstone and Googles CMO Lorraine Twohill and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen11Page responded to a question about corporations noting that corporations largely get a bad rap which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing 50 or 20 years ago He went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of Google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceXHe Musk wants to go to Mars to back up humanity Thats arate Page mentioned Elon Musk and SpaceXHe Musk wants to go to Mars to back up humanity Thats a worthy goal We have a lot of employees at Google whove become pretty wealthy Youre working because you want to change the world and make it better Id like for us to help out more than we are80Page also mentioned Nikola Tesla with regard to invention and commercializationInvention is not enough Nikola Tesla invented the electric power we use but he struggled to get it out to people You have to combine both things invention and innovation focus plus a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people81Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for daytoday productrelated decision making In a memo Page said that Googles core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects including Google X initiatives access and energy includingnext generation of ambitious projects including Google X initiatives access and energy including Google Fiber smarthome automation through Nest Labs and biotechnology innovations under Calico82 Page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial chief product officer66 Subsequent to the announcement the executives in charge of Googles core products reported to then Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai who reported directly to Page82838485In a November 2014 interview Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his deep knowledge of Googles products and breadth of projects as it had been a key motivating factor for team members About his then role as the companys CEO Page said I think my job as CEOI feel like its always to be pushing people ahead66On August 10 2015 Page announced on Googles official blog that Google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichainew holding company known as Alphabet Inc with Page becoming CEO of Alphabet Inc and Sundar Pichai assuming the position of CEO of Google Inc In his announcement Page described the planned holding company as follows86Alphabet is mostly a collection of companies The largest of which of course is Google This newer Google is a bit slimmed down with the companies that are pretty far afield of our main Internet products contained in Alphabet instead Fundamentally we believe this allows us more management scale as we can run things independently that arent very relatedAs well as explaining the origin of the companys nameWe liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanitys most important innovations and is the core of how we index with Google search We also like that it means alphabet Alpha is investment return above benchmark which we strive forPage wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google cleaner and moreforPage wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make Google cleaner and more accountable He also wrote that there was a desire to improve the transparency and oversight of what were doing and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the Google ecosystem868788Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013 The Bloomberg Businessweek termed the reorganization into Alphabet a clever retirement plan allowing Page to retain control over Google at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it Executives at Alphabet describe Page as a futurist highly detached from daytoday business dealings and more focused on moonshot projects While some managers of Alphabet companies speak of Page as intensely involved others say that his rare office checkins are akin to a royal visit892019On

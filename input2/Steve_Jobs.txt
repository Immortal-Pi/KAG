political science at thedegree at the American University of Beirut Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin There he met Joanne Schieble an American Catholic of SwissGerman descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate in Green Bay The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schiebles father due to Jandalis Muslim faith When Schieble became pregnant she arranged for a closed adoption and travelled to San Francisco to give birth5Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates A lawyer and his wife were selected but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara ne Hagopian Jobs Paul Jobs an American of German descent was the son of a dairy farmer from Washington County Wisconsin After dropping out of high school he worked as a mechanic then joined the US Coast Guard When his ship was decommissioned at San Francisco he bet he could find a wife

ten days later in March 1946 and married that same year The couple moved to Wisconsin then Indiana where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman Since Clara missed San Francisco she convinced Paul to move back There Paul worked as a repossession agent and Clara became a bookkeeper In 1955 after having an ectopic pregnancy the couple looked to adopt a child5 Since they lacked a college education Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their sons college tuition56InfancyIn his youth Jobss parents took him to a Lutheran church7 When Steve was in high school Clara admitted to his girlfriend Chrisann Brennan that she wasWhen Steve was in high school Clara admitted to his girlfriend Chrisann Brennan that she was too frightened to love Steve for the first six months of his life I was scared they were going to take him away from me Even after we won the case Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake I wanted to return him When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve he stated that he was already aware8 and later said that he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara Jobs would bristle when Paul and Clara were referred to as his adoptive parents and he regarded them as his parents 1000 Jobs referred to his biological parents as my sperm and egg bank Thats not harsh its just the way it was a sperm bank thing nothing more9ChildhoodI always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid but I liked electronics then I read something that one of my heroes Edwin Land of Polaroid said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersectionEdwin Land of Polaroid said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences and I decided thats what I wanted to doSteve Jobs10Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist11 several other jobs12 and then back to work as a machinist Paul and Clara adopted Jobss sister Patricia in 195713 and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View California14 Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to pass along his love of mechanics Jobs meanwhile admired his fathers craftsmanship because he knew how to build anything If we needed a cabinet he would build it When he built our fence he gave me a hammer so I could work with him I wasnt that into fixing cars but I was eager to hang out with my dad15The childhood family home of Steve Jobs on Crist Drive in Los Altos California is the original site of Apple Computer The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites inis the original site of Apple Computer The home was added to a list of historic Los Altos sites in 201316Jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom tended to resist authority figures frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary School in Mountain View His father Paul who was abused as a child never reprimanded him however and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son17 Jobs skipped the 5th grade and transferred to the 6th grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a socially awkward loner18 Jobs was often bullied at Crittenden Middle and in the middle of 7th grade he gave his parents an ultimatum either they would take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school19The Jobs family was not affluent and only by expending all their savings were they able to buy a new home in 1967 allowing Steve to change schools The new house a threebedroom home onto buy a new home in 1967 allowing Steve to change schools The new house a threebedroom home on Crist Drive in Los Altos California was in the better Cupertino School District in Cupertino California20 The house was declared a historic site in 2013 as the first site of Apple Computer16 As of 2013update it was owned by Jobss sister Patty and occupied by his stepmother Marilyn21 When he was 13 in 196822 Jobs was given a summer job by Bill Hewlett of HewlettPackard after Jobs coldcalled him to ask for parts for an electronics project23Homestead HighJobss Homestead High School yearbook photo 1972The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to attend nearby Homestead High School which had strong ties to Silicon Valley10 He began his first year there in late 1968 along with Bill Fernandez24 who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak and would become Apples first employee Neither Jobs nor Fernandez whose father was a lawyer came from engineering households and thus decided toJobs nor Fernandez whose father was a lawyer came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in John McCollums Electronics I class24 Jobs had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with McCollum and lost interest in the class24Jobs underwent a change during mid1970 He later noted to his official biographer that I started to listen to music a whole lot and I started to read more outside of just science and technology Shakespeare Plato I loved King Lear when I was a senior I had this phenomenal AP English class The teacher was this guy who looked like Ernest Hemingway He took a bunch of us snowshoeing in Yosemite During his last two years at Homestead High Jobs developed two different interests electronics and literature25 These dual interests were particularly reflected during Jobss senior year as his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend the artistic Homestead junior Chrisannas his best friends were Wozniak and his first girlfriend the artistic Homestead junior Chrisann Brennan26In 1971 after Wozniak began attending University of California Berkeley Jobs would visit him there a few times a week This experience led him to study in nearby Stanford Universitys student union Instead of joining the electronics club Jobs put on light shows with a friend for Homesteads avantgarde jazz program He was described by a Homestead classmate as kind of brain and kind of hippie but he never fit into either group He was smart enough to be a nerd but wasnt nerdy And he was too intellectual for the hippies who just wanted to get wasted all the time He was kind of an outsider In high school everything revolved around what group you were in and if you werent in a carefully defined group you werent anybody He was an individual in a world where individuality was suspect By his senior year in late 1971 he was taking a freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homesteadyear in late 1971 he was taking a freshman English class at Stanford and working on a Homestead underground film project with Chrisann Brennan2728Around that time Wozniak designed a lowcost digital blue box to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network allowing free longdistance calls He was inspired by an article titled Secrets of the Little Blue Box from the October 1971 issue of Esquire29 Jobs decided then to sell them and split the profit with Wozniak The clandestine sales of the illegal blue boxes went well and perhaps planted the seed in Jobss mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable30 In a 1994 interview he recalled that it took six months for him and Wozniak to design the blue boxes31 Jobs later reflected that had it not been for Wozniaks blue boxes there wouldnt have been an Apple32 He states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them3334By his senior year of high school Jobs began using LSD25 He later recalledand beat them3334By his senior year of high school Jobs began using LSD25 He later recalled that on one occasion he consumed it in a wheat field outside Sunnyvale and experienced the most wonderful feeling of my life up to that point35 In mid1972 after graduation and before leaving for Reed College Jobs and Brennan rented a house from their other roommate Al36Reed CollegeIn September 1972 Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland Oregon37 He insisted on applying only to Reed although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford38 Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland39 who was Reeds student body president at that time40 Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at ReedI was interested in Eastern mysticism which hit the shores about then At Reed there was a constant flow of people stopping by from Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert to Gary Snyder There was a constant flow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life That was the time when every collegeflow of intellectual questioning about the truth of life That was the time when every college student in the country read Be Here Now and Diet for a Small PlanetSteve Jobs41After just one semester Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents42 Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents money on an education that seemed meaningless to him He continued to attend by auditing his classes43 including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University Jobs stated that during this period he slept on the floor in friends dorm rooms returned Coke bottles for food money and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple In that same speech Jobs said If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced

it was a very young and idealistic industry There werent many degrees offered in computer science so people in computers were brilliant people from mathematics physics music zoology whatever They loved it and no one was really in it for the money There are people around here who start companies just to make money but the great companies well thats not what theyre aboutSteve Jobs45PreAppleIn February 1974 Jobs returned to his parents home in Los Altos and began looking for a job46 He was soon hired by Atari Inc in Los Gatos California as a computer technician4647 Back in 1973 Steve Wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game Pong and gave its electronics board to Jobs According to Wozniak Atari only hired Jobs because he took the board down to the company and they thought that he had built it himself48 Ataris cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him asthey thought that he had built it himself48 Ataris cofounder Nolan Bushnell later described him as difficult but valuable pointing out that he was very often the smartest guy in the room and he would let people know that49Jobs traveled to India in mid197450 to visit Neem Karoli Baba51 at his Kainchi ashram with his Reed College friend and eventual Apple employee Daniel Kottke searching for spiritual teachings When they got to the Neem Karoli ashram it was almost deserted because Neem Karoli Baba had died in September 1973 Then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of Haidakhan Babaji47After seven months Jobs left India52 and returned to the US ahead of Daniel Kottke47 Jobs had changed his appearance his head was shaved and he wore traditional Indian clothing5354 During this time Jobs experimented with psychedelics later calling his LSD experiences one of the two or three most important things he had done in his life5556 He spent a period at the All One Farm a commune inimportant things he had done in his life5556 He spent a period at the All One Farm a commune in Oregon that was owned by Robert FriedlandDuring this time period Jobs and Brennan both became practitioners of Zen Buddhism through the Zen master Kbun Chino Otogawa Jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center the oldest St Zen monastery in the US57 He considered taking up monastic residence at Eiheiji in Japan and maintained a lifelong appreciation for Zen58 Japanese cuisine and artists such as Hasui Kawase59Jobs returned to Atari in early 1975 and that summer Bushnell assigned him to create a circuit board for the arcade video game Breakout in as few chips as possible knowing that Jobs would recruit Wozniak for help During his day job at HP Wozniak drew sketches of the circuit design at night he joined Jobs at Atari and continued to refine the design which Jobs implemented on a breadboard60 According to Bushnell Atari offered 100 equivalent to aboutJobs implemented on a breadboard60 According to Bushnell Atari offered 100 equivalent to about 600 in 2023 for each TTL chip that was eliminated in the machine Jobs made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips Much to the amazement of Atari engineers within four days Wozniak reduced the TTL count to 45 far below the usual 100 though Atari later reengineered it to make it easier to test and add a few missing features61 According to Wozniak Jobs told him that Atari paid them only 750 instead of the actual 5000 and that Wozniaks share was thus 37562 Wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later but said that if Jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money Wozniak would have given it to him63Jobs and Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975 which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first Apple computer64 According to a document releasedto the development and marketing of the first Apple computer64 According to a document released by the United States Department of Defense Jobs claimed that in 1975 he was arrested in Eugene Oregon after being questioned for being a minor in possession of alcohol Jobs alleged that he didnt have any alcohol but police questioned him and subsequently determined that he had an outstanding arrest warrant for an unpaid speeding ticket Jobs claimed he then paid the 50 fine The arrest allegedly occurred behind a store6566Apple 19761985Basically Steve Wozniak and I invented the Apple because we wanted a personal computer Not only couldnt we afford the computers that were on the market those computers were impractical for us to use We needed a Volkswagen The Volkswagen isnt as fast or comfortable as other ways of traveling but the VW owners can go where they want when they want and with whom they want The VW owners have personal control of their carSteve Jobs67By March 1976 Wozniak completedwant The VW owners have personal control of their carSteve Jobs67By March 1976 Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer and showed it to Jobs who suggested that they sell it Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed68 In April of that same year Jobs Wozniak and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company now called Apple Inc as a business partnership in Jobss parents Crist Drive home on April 1 1976 The operation originally started in Jobss bedroom and later moved to the garage6970 Wayne stayed briefly leaving Jobs and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company71The two decided on the name Apple after Jobs returned from the All One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the farms apple orchard72 Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for 50 equivalent to about 270 in 2023 each To fund the first batch Wozniak sold his HPhobbyists for 50 equivalent to about 270 in 2023 each To fund the first batch Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van7374 Later that year computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for 500 each7576 Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total77External image Jobs and Steve Wozniak with an Apple I circuit board c 1976A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients with his underwear hanging out barefoot and hippielike Another neighbor Larry Waterland who had just earned his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford recalled dismissing Jobss budding business compared to the established industry of giant mainframe computers with big decks of punch cards Steve took me over to the garage He had a circuit board with a chip on it a DuMont TV set a Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard He said This is an Apple computer I said Youve got to be joking I dismissed thedeck and a keyboard He said This is an Apple computer I said Youve got to be joking I dismissed the whole idea Jobss friend from Reed College and India Daniel Kottke recalled that as an early Apple employee he was the only person who worked in the garage Woz would show up once a week with his latest code Steve Jobs didnt get his hands dirty in that sense Kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in Jobss kitchen where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company21They received funding from a thensemiretired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula78 Scott McNealy one of the cofounders of Sun Microsystems said that Jobs broke a glass age ceiling in Silicon Valley because hed created a very successful company at a young age34 Markkula brought Apple to the attention of Arthur Rock which after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home Brew Computer Show started with a 60000 investment and went on the Apple board79 Jobsat the Home Brew Computer Show started with a 60000 investment and went on the Apple board79 Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott from National Semiconductor in February 1977 to serve as the first president and CEO of Apple8081For what characterizes Apple is that its scientific staff always acted and performed like artists in a field filled with dry personalities limited by the rational and binary worlds they inhabit Apples engineering teams had passion They always believed that what they were doing was important and most of all fun Working at Apple was never just a job it was also a crusade a mission to bring better computer power to people At its roots that attitude came from Steve Jobs It was Power to the People the slogan of the sixties rewritten in technology for the eighties and called MacintoshJeffrey S Young 198782After Brennan returned from her own journey to India she and Jobs fell in love again as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to KobunIndia she and Jobs fell in love again as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to Kobun whom she was also still following It was also at this time that Jobs displayed a prototype Apple II computer for Brennan and his parents in their living room Brennan notes a shift in this time period where the two main influences on Jobs were Apple Inc and KobunIn April 1977 Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the West Coast Computer Faire83 It is the first consumer product to have been sold by Apple Computer Primarily designed by Wozniak Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply84 During the design stage Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots while Wozniak wanted eight After a heated argument Wozniak threatened that Jobs should go get himself another computer They later agreed on eight slots85 The Apple II became one of the first highly successful massproduced microcomputer products in the world86AsII became one of the first highly successful massproduced microcomputer products in the world86As Jobs became more successful with his new company his relationship with Brennan grew more complex In 1977 the success of Apple was now a part of their relationship and Brennan Daniel Kottke and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino87 Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple88 Brennans relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position with Apple grew and she began to consider ending the relationship In October 1977 Brennan was approached by Rod Holt who asked her to take a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples89 Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for her given her artistic abilities Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it Brennans decision however was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the fatherwas overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father It took her a few days to tell Jobs whose face according to Brennan turned ugly at the news At the same time according to Brennan at the beginning of her third trimester Jobs said to her I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion I just didnt want to do that90 He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her90Brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave Apple A few weeks before she was due to give birth Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the All One Farm She accepted the offer89 When Jobs was 23 the same age as his biological parents when they had him90 Brennan gave birth to her baby Lisa Brennan on May 17 197889 Jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland their mutual friend and the farm owner While distant Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket Brennan suggested the namethe baby which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket Brennan suggested the name Lisa which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name Lisa while he was also publicly denying paternity She would discover later that during this time Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name his first choice was Claire after St Clare She stated that she never gave him permission to use the babys name for a computer and he hid the plans from her Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase Local Integrated Software Architecture as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa91 Decades later however Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that obviously it was named for my daughter92When Jobs denied paternity a DNA test established him as Lisas father93 It required him to pay Brennan 385 equivalent to about 1200 in 2023 monthly in addition to returning the welfare money she had received Jobs paid her1200 in 2023 monthly in addition to returning the welfare money she had received Jobs paid her 500 equivalent to about 1500 in 2023 monthly at the time when Apple went public and made him a millionaire Later Brennan agreed to an interview with Michael Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special released on January 3 1983 in which she discussed her relationship with Jobs Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year the magazine named the generic personal computer the Machine of the Year94 In the issue Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test which stated that the probability of paternity for Jobs Steven is 94193 He responded by arguing that 28 of the male population of the United States could be the father Time also noted that the baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name Lisa93In 1978 at age 23 Jobs was worth over 1 million equivalent to 467million in 2023 By age 25 his net worth grew to anJobs was worth over 1 million equivalent to 467million in 2023 By age 25 his net worth grew to an estimated 250 million equivalent to 838million in 2023 He was also one of the youngest people ever to make the Forbes list of the nations richest peopleand one of only a handful to have done it themselves without inherited wealth95 In 1982 Jobs bought an apartment on the top two floors of The San Remo a Manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation Although he never lived there96 he spent years renovating it thanks to I M Pei In 1983 Jobs lured John Sculley away from PepsiCola to serve as Apples CEO asking Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world97In 1984 Jobs bought the Jackling House and estate and resided there for a decade Thereafter he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house allowing weathering to degrade it In 2004 Jobs received permission from the town ofthe house allowing weathering to degrade it In 2004 Jobs received permission from the town of Woodside to demolish the house to build a smaller contemporary styled one After a few years in court the house was finally demolished in 2011 a few months before he died98A Macintosh prototype c1981Jobs and the Macintosh 1984Jobs took over development of the Macintosh in 1981 from early Apple employee Jef Raskin who had conceived the project Wozniak and Raskin had heavily influenced the early program and Wozniak was on leave during this time due to an airplane crash earlier that year making it easier for Jobs to take over the project99100101 On January 22 1984 Apple aired a Super Bowl television commercial titled 1984 which ended with the words On January 24th Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh And youll see why 1984 wont be like 1984102 On January 24 1984 an emotional Jobs introduced the Macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience at Apples annual shareholders meeting held in the FlintMacintosh

The Macintosh was inspired by the Lisa in turn inspired by Xerox PARCs mousedriven graphical user interface106107 and it was widely acclaimed by the media with strong initial sales108109 However its low performance and limited range of available software led to a rapid sales decline in the second half of 1984108109110Sculleys and Jobss respective visions for the company greatly differed Sculley favored open architecture computers like the Apple II targeting education small business and home markets less vulnerable to IBM Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobss Macintosh division it and the Apple II division operated like separatechairman of the board Jobss Macintosh division it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies duplicating services111 Although its products provided 85 of Apples sales in early 1985 the companys January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees Many left including Wozniak who stated that the company had been going in the wrong direction for the last five years and sold most of his stock112 Though frustrated with the companys and Jobss dismissal of the Apple II in favor of the Macintosh Wozniak left amicably and remained an honorary employee of Apple maintaining a lifelong friendship with Jobs113114115Jobs with software developer Wendell Brown 1984By early 1985 the Macintoshs failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear108109 and it strengthened Sculleys

response Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple However Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked and he said that he would leave Apple The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization A few months later on September 17 1985 Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture NeXT117The Macintoshs struggle continued after Jobs left Apple Though marketed and received in fanfare the expensive Macintosh was hard to sell118308309 In 1985 Bill Gatess thendeveloping company Microsoft threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted a licensecompany Microsoft threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted a license for the Mac operating system software Microsoft was developing its graphical user interface for DOS which it was calling Windows and didnt want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface118321 Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple118321 In addition cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear Although the Macintosh preceded the clones it was far more expensive so through the late 1980s the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple118322 Windowsbased IBMPC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBMs TopView or Digital Researchs GEM118322 and thus the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted undermining the most apparent advantage of the Macit

Disney Animation Studios President Edwin Catmull revealed that Jobs once advised him to just explain it to them until they understand in disagreements Catmull released the book Creativity Inc in 2014 in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with Jobs Regarding his own manner of dealing with Jobs Catmull writes143In all the 26 years with Steve Steve and I never had one of these loud verbal arguments and its not my nature to do that but we did disagree fairly frequently about things I would say something to him and he would immediately shoot it down because he could think faster than I could I would then wait a week Id call him up and I give my counterargument to what he had said and hed immediately shoot it down So I had to wait another week and occasionally this went on for months But ultimately one of three things happened About aweek and occasionally this went on for months But ultimately one of three things happened About a third of the time he said Oh I get it youre right and that was the end of it And it was another third of the time in which Id say Actually I think he is right The other third of the time where we didnt reach consensus he just let me do it my

program for Macintosh clones making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machinesWith the purchase of NeXT much of the companys technology found its way into Apple products most

and other advocates at Apples annual meeting in Cupertino in April A few weeks later Apple announced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores The Computer TakeBack Campaign responded by

businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends He summed up this selfconcept at the end of his keynote speech at the Macworld Conference and Expo in January 2007 by quoting ice hockey player Wayne GretzkyTheres an old Wayne Gretzky quote that I love I skate to where the puck is going to be not where it

medicine Other doctors agree that Jobss diet was insufficient to address his disease However cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski wrote that its impossible to know whether and by how much he might have decreased his chances of surviving his cancer through his flirtation with woo My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival if

where she was a student Soon after the event he stated that Laurene was right there in the front row in the lecture hall and I couldnt take my eyes off of her kept losing my train of thought and started feeling a little giddy282 After the lecture he met her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner From that point forward they were together with a few minor exceptions for the rest of his life283Jobs proposed on New Years Day 1990 they married on March 18 1991 in afor the rest of his life283Jobs proposed on New Years Day 1990 they married on March 18 1991 in a Buddhist ceremony at

stipulated that most of his monetary fortune would not be left to his children289290FamilyChrisann Brennan notes that after Jobs was forced out of Apple he apologized many times over for his behavior towards her and Lisa She said Jobs said that he never took responsibility when he should have and that he was sorry291 By this time Jobs had developed a strong relationship with Lisa and when she was nine Jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from Lisa Brennan to Lisa BrennanJobs8 Jobs and Brennan developed a working relationship to coparent Lisa a change which Brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister Mona Simpson who worked to repair the relationship between Lisa and Jobs8 Jobs had found Mona after first finding his birth mother Joanne Schieble Simpson shortly after he left Apple292Jobs did not contact his birth family during hisSchieble Simpson shortly after he left Apple292Jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother Claras lifetime however He later told his official biographer Walter Isaacson I never wanted Paul and Clara to feel like I didnt consider them my parents because they were totally my parents I loved them so much that I never wanted them to know of my search and I even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out292 However in 1986 when Jobs was 31 Clara was diagnosed with lung cancer He began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption information that motivated him to find his biological mother Jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the San Francisco doctor to whom Schieble had turned when she was pregnant Although the doctor did not help Jobs while he was alive he left a letter for Jobs to be opened upon his death As he died soon afterwards Jobs was given the letter which stated that his motherupon his death As he died soon afterwards Jobs was given the letter which stated that his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from Wisconsin named Joanne Schieble292Jobs only contacted Schieble after Clara died in early 1986 and after he received permission from his father Paul In addition out of respect for Paul he asked the media not to report on his search292 Jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need to see if she was okay and to thank her because Im glad I didnt end up as an abortion She was twentythree and she went through a lot to have me293 Schieble was emotional during their first meeting though she wasnt familiar with the history of Apple or Jobss role in it and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers She said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it Jobs and Schieble developed a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and spent Christmasand Schieble developed a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and spent Christmas together294During this first visit Schieble told Jobs that he had a sister Mona who was not aware that she had a brother293 Schieble then arranged for them to meet in New York where Mona worked Her first impression of Jobs was that he was totally straightforward and lovely just a normal and sweet guy295 Simpson and Jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other295 Jobs later told his biographer that Mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me As we got to know each other we became really good friends and she is my family I dont know what Id do without her I cant imagine a better sister My adopted sister Patty and I were never close295I grew up as an only child with a single mother Because we were poor and because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif I hopedand because I knew my father had emigrated from Syria I imagined he looked like Omar Sharif I hoped he would be rich and kind and would come into our lives and our notyetfurnished apartment and help us Later after Id met my father I tried to believe hed changed his number and left no forwarding address because he was an idealistic revolutionary plotting a new world for the Arab people Even as a feminist my whole life Id been waiting for a man to love who could love me For decades Id thought that man would be my father When I was 25 I met that man and he was my brotherMona Simpson219Jobs then learned his family history Six months after he was given up for adoption Schiebles father died she wed Jandali and they had a daughter Mona296297 Jandali states that after finishing his PhD he returned to Syria to work and then Schieble left him296 They divorced in 196210 and he said then he lost contact with Mona for a timeI also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when shecontact with Mona for a timeI also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old as her mother divorced me when I went to Syria but we got back in touch after 10 years We lost touch again when her mother moved and I didnt know where she was but since 10 years ago weve been in constant contact and I see her three times a year I organized a trip for her last year to visit Syria and Lebanon and she went with a relative from Florida296A few years later Schieble married an iceskating teacher George Simpson Mona Jandali took her stepfathers last name as Mona Simpson In 1970 after divorcing her second husband Schieble took Mona to Los Angeles and raised her alone297When Simpson found that their father Abdulfattah Jandali was living in Sacramento California Jobs had no interest in meeting him as he believed Jandali did not treat his children well298 and according to the San Francisco Chronicle this was because of finding a Seattle Times article aboutaccording to the San Francisco Chronicle this was because of finding a Seattle Times article about Jandalis abandonment of his students on a trip to Egypt in 1974299 Simpson went to Sacramento alone and met Jandali who worked in a small restaurant They spoke for several hours and he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business He said he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that well never see that baby again That babys gone He said he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that all of the successful technology people used to come there Even Steve Jobs oh yeah he used to come in and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper At the request of Jobs Simpson did not reveal to Jandali that his own story meant that he had actually already met his son300After hearing about the visit Jobs recalled that it was amazing I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner He was Syrian Balding We shook hands However Jobsa few times and I remember meeting the owner He was Syrian Balding We shook hands However Jobs still did not want to meet Jandali because I was a wealthy man by then and I didnt trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it I asked Mona not to tell him about me300 Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog He then contacted Simpson and asked what is this thing about Steve Jobs Simpson told him that it was true and later commented My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller but he is very very passive He never contacted Steve Because Simpson herself researched her Syrian roots and began to meet the family she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father but he never did Jobs also never showed an interest in his Syrian heritage or the Middle East Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in her 1992 novel The Lost Father294 Malek Jandali is their cousin301PhilanthropyJobss views and actions on philanthropyLost Father294 Malek Jandali is their cousin301PhilanthropyJobss views and actions on philanthropy and charity are a public mystery302 He maintained privacy even over what few of these actions were publicly known He has been a key figure in public discussions about societal obligations of the wealthy and powerful Through his career the media investigated and criticized him and Apple as unusually and inexplicably mysterious or absent among powerful leaders and especially billionaires His name is absent from the Million Dollar List of all large global philanthropy303 Some have speculated about his possible secret role in large anonymous donations302Mark Vermilion former charitable leader for Joan Baez Apple and Jobs attributed Jobss lifelong minimization of direct charity to his perfectionism and limited time Jobs Vermilion and supporters said over the years that corporate products were Jobss superior contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity303 In 1985 Jobs saidJobss superior contributions to culture and society instead of direct charity303 In 1985 Jobs said You know my main reaction to this money thing is that its humorous all the attention to it because its hardly the most insightful or valuable thing thats happened to me302Shortly after leaving Apple he formed the charitable Steven P Jobs Foundation led by Mark Vermilion hired away from Apples community leadership Jobs wanted a focus on nutrition and vegetarianism but Vermilion wanted social entrepreneurship That year Jobs soon launched NeXT and closed the foundation with no results Upon his 1997 return to Apple Jobs optimized the failing company to the core such as eliminating all philanthropic programs never to be restored In 2007 Stanford Social Innovation Review magazine listed Apple among Americas least philanthropic companies A few months after another unflattering news report Apple started a program to match employees charitable gifts303 Jobs declined to sign The Giving Pledgestarted a program to match employees charitable gifts303 Jobs declined to sign The Giving Pledge launched in 2010 by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates for fellow billionaires303302 He donated 50 million to Stanford hospital and contributed to efforts
